# Mastodon YRYR-Glitch

> Now with 100% more Yui Funami!

So here's the deal: assets are customized, you are on your own replacing our assets with yours (or vanilla ones)

Added features over glitch-soc:
- Nori tokenizer for better Korean search (You **MUST** use {Elastic,Open}Search with necessary plugins installed, otherwise search feature won't work *at all*)
- YuruVerse assets (logos, etc)
- Birdsite theme adapted to glitch-soc based forks
- Pretendard font for better Korean glyphs
- Emoji reactions! (compatible with Misskey of course)
- And more things...?

We also recommend applying wide custom emoji CSS for better experience.
